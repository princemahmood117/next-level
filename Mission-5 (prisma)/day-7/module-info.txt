day 7 will include : 

-> divide the schemas into multiple schemas (post.schema, comment.schema, etc)

-> create a subfolder "schema" inside the folder "prisma"

-> move the schema.prisma into the "schema" sub-folder

-> move the schema codes into seperate file (ex: all posts into post.schema)

-> change the schema_location from prisma.config.ts : schema: "prisma/schema", [means all the schemas will be present inside this location/folder]

-> set the output location to "output   = "../../generated/prisma"" in schema.prisma so that after running "npx prisma generate" the generated folder will be at the root
