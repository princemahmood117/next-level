learning next js from the scratch



create next project-command : npx create-next-app@latest my-app --yes

use shadcn/ui for ui components


"use client"  ---> the THING is rendered on the browser only, not server

* to use error.tsx, the component must have "use client" at the top

* to use any hooks (useState/useEffect...) the component must have "use client" at the top



** run project on production : npm run start


use client ---> makes the component "client component" after built from server side
	   ---> use this when there is needed "interactivity" (like form / hooks)

@(folder_name) ---> this also does not count as route
